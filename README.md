# CRUD_Angular_WebAPI

This is a simple app demonstrating the creation of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using AngularJS & Web API.  In developing it I chose to use angularjs v1.6, Visual Studio 2017, Entity Framework 6, Web API 2.0,.

For the back end I use dependency injection, repository & unit of work design patterns. The Repository is generic with a class type constraint in order to allow for more entities to be added later.  I also use dependency injection in the angular scripts following a standard angular controller, factory, and service pattern.
